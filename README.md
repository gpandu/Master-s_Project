User Authentication Using Face

This project is a part of building Multimodal authentication system using Keystrokes,
Facial features and mouse dynamics. Authentication using facial features involves Face detection followed by face Recognition task. A HOG features based model is trained using Support Vector Machine to detect faces in the images. Sparse representation-based
classification with local binary patterns is designed and implemented for face recognition.
